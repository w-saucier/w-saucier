## Hi there, Im Wade ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m currently learning to code, which means youâ€™ll find a lot of experiments, questionable code choices, and occasional breakthroughsâ€”feel free to offer advice, encouragement, or just a good laugh!

Passionate about exploring and mastering new technologies, I use GitHub as a personal platform to document my self-learning journey and collaborate with like-minded individuals. I aim to improve my skills in various domains such as software development, data science, cloud computing, and more.
